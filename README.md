#File Uploading with Spring and Angular 6

Recently, lot of students asked me about file uploading. This is a simple demo project to demonstrate how to do file uploading using Spring and the Angular. 

There are three backend modules which show a different way of handling multipart requests in Spring application.

* Backend  - 1 (Using StandardServeletMultipartResolver)
* Backend - 2 (Using Apache Commons File Uploads)
* Backend - 3 (Using Spring Boot)

Hope you guys enjoy!
